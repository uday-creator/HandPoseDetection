# HandPoseDetection
This is an OpenCV project based on mediapipe pretrained model.
In this project we hve first detected landmarks n our hand and joined them with drawing utils section
Next I have detected angles between different joints in our fingers with the help of numpy amd matpltlib library
All model is based in real time scenario.
Note: This is only backend written purely in python.
